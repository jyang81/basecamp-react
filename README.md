# BaseCamp

#### *A multi-component dashboard app for coding bootcamp students to keep organized and on track throughout their program.*

### Motivation

I created BaseCamp because I wanted a home base for all of my bootcamp related activities/ideas/feelings/tips/etc. I found that I was taking notes and jotting down ideas in several different places, and I wanted to have a 'single source of truth' for all of my notes that I could easily access in an organized manner.

Attending a bootcamp is a pretty intense experience. There is so much information thrown at you, and it goes by so fast. I wanted to create an app to help bring order to some of the craziness that is bootcamp life.

### Overview

The BaseCamp dashboard is made up of 5 main components:
- A **graduation countdown timer** that shows how many days you have left, in addition to a progress bar showing percentage of program completed
- A **daily mood tracker** to keep track of how you are feeling on a scale of 1 to 10 during each day of the program visualized in a github calendar style format
- A **to do list** to keep track of the many tasks you are required to do outside of the basic labs and projects
- A **note board** to organize all of your ideas, shortcuts, tips, etc. onto categorized sticky notes
- A **help button** that displays a rubber duck to help you debug code when you get stuck (known as "rubber duck debugging")

A user can update their user info, including school, course, and end date if they decide to change programs or delay their graduation date.
